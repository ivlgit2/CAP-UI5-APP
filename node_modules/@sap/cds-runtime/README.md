# CDS Runtime #

With the CDS Node.js runtime library services can be provided and consumed through synchronous as well as asynchronous APIs. Based on ubiquitous notions of events and queries, it allows implementing services in protocol-agnostic and platform-agnostic ways.

The CDS Runtime is part of the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model. Please visit https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/ to learn about provided features, installation and usage.

The CDS Runtime module is the successor of `@sap/cds-services`, `@sap/cds-ql`, `@sap/cds-messaging`, `@sap/cds-rest`, `@sap/cds-hana`, `@sap/cds-sqlite` and `@sap/cds-sql`. Please note that future development and bug fixes will be provided in the CDS Runtime module only.
